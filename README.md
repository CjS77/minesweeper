# Minesweeper

An agentic bughunter. It uses Claude Code as a harness in order to automatically identify, screen, evaluate, and fix
issues in a repository's GitHub repo.

Minesweeper periodically:

* Pulls a list of issues from GitHub.
* If the issue is eligible, then Minesweeper enters planning mode.
* Once planning mode is complete, Minesweeper enters assess mode.
* If assess mode decides to execute, Minesweeper enters execution mode.
* If assess mode decides the plan is too complex, it enters refine mode.
* Once execution mode is complete, a new pull request is opened on GitHub.
* Once refine mode is complete, the issue is updated with a checklist of all the sub-issues that were created.

# Requirements

* [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (the CLI) — drives the agent loop via `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`.
* [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) authenticated against the repo (`gh auth login` or `GH_TOKEN`).
* Node.js 20 or later.
* `git` 2.20+ (for `git worktree`).

# Architecture

The detailed architecture and decision log live in `~/.claude/plans/i-need-an-application-snazzy-axolotl.md`. The
implementation is sequenced as numbered plans in [`plans/`](./plans/00_index.md).

In brief, Minesweeper is structured as **one long-running daemon plus one short-lived child process per in-flight
issue**:

* **Daemon (`minesweeper run`)** — polls GitHub, runs the eligibility filter, owns worktree lifecycle, and supervises
  one child per issue. The daemon is the only process that ever talks to `gh` (with one carve-out: the executor
  subagent runs `git commit` itself inside the worktree).
* **Child (`minesweeper handle <issue#>`)** — spawned by the supervisor with `cwd` set to a freshly created
  `git worktree`. The child drives the role agents (planner ↔ critic, then executor ↔ reviewer) via the Claude Agent
  SDK. State is persisted to `.minesweeper/state.json` inside the worktree so a crashed child can be resumed.
* **Worktree lifecycle** — the daemon creates the worktree under `$MINESWEEPER_WORKTREE_PATH/<branch>`. The worktree
  stays on disk for the entire life of the issue: on a clean exit (`code === 0`) the daemon leaves it alone so the
  reviewer of the open PR can inspect `.minesweeper/`; on a non-zero exit it labels the issue with
  `$MINESWEEPER_FAILED_LABEL` and again leaves the worktree in place for post-mortem. Each poll tick the daemon then
  runs a closed-issue sweep — for every worktree whose issue is now `CLOSED` (PR merged, manually closed, or "not
  planned"), it archives `.minesweeper/` under `archive/<issue>-<timestamp>/` and removes the worktree.

## Issue eligibility

You can control whether an issue is autonomously handled via repository labels and environment variables. When the
daemon polls, every open issue is run through the filter in this order — the first rule that matches wins:

1. `MINESWEEPER_NEVER_FIX_LABEL` → ineligible (hard opt-out).
2. `MINESWEEPER_MANUALLY_APPROVED_LABEL` → eligible (human signed off).
3. `MINESWEEPER_FAILED_LABEL` → ineligible (don't reattempt past failures automatically).
4. `MINESWEEPER_POSSIBLY_DANGEROUS_LABEL` → ineligible (flagged by the screen, awaiting review).
5. `MINESWEEPER_ALWAYS_FIX_LABEL` → eligible (the standard opt-in; **skips the screener**).
6. `MINESWEEPER_TRY_FIX_LABEL` → eligible **after the prompt-injection screener clears it**. Use this for issues you want
   processed but want screened first — it runs the screener regardless of `MINESWEEPER_DEFAULT_ELIGIBLE`. A `dangerous`
   verdict swaps the label for `MINESWEEPER_POSSIBLY_DANGEROUS_LABEL` and posts an explanatory comment; an `uncertain`
   verdict applies the same label silently. Either way, a human can override by replacing the label with
   `MINESWEEPER_MANUALLY_APPROVED_LABEL`.
7. Otherwise → fall back to `MINESWEEPER_DEFAULT_ELIGIBLE` (default `false`); when `true`, the issue is screened.

Closed issues are always ineligible.

When reading an issue, Minesweeper will (in M2) decide whether it's a legitimate issue or an attempt to inject
malicious code via issue-hijacking or prompt injection. If the latter, it marks the issue with
`MINESWEEPER_POSSIBLY_DANGEROUS_LABEL` and skips it. Until that screen lands, keep `MINESWEEPER_DEFAULT_ELIGIBLE=false`
and rely on the always-fix label.

### Planning mode

In planning mode, the per-issue child process:

* Loads the issue in context.
* Sets `mode` to `Planning`, `status` to `InProgress`, `iterations` to 0.
* Reads its working directory — the worktree under `${MINESWEEPER_WORKTREE_PATH}/{branchname}` — which the **parent
  daemon** has already created. All further work for the issue happens inside this worktree; the main checkout is
  never touched.
* Persists `.minesweeper/state.json` recording the state of the issue.
* Starts a subagent in planning mode to deliver a plan to resolve the issue.

* Then until `state.status` is `Complete` or `state.iterations` >= `state.max_iterations`:
    * Starts another sub-agent — preferably using a different LLM model — to critique the current plan. The LLM is
      told to take particular note of any comments under the heading "Execution Plan review" and to be sure to address
      all points brought up there.
    * The sub-agent only sees the current plan, the issue, and the source code. It does not see the full iteration
      history.
    * The sub-agent responds with its critique and a summary, one of:
        * Approved
        * Approved, with comments
        * Request changes
    * If the status is `Approved`, then `state.status` is set to `Complete`.
    * If the status is `Approved, with comments`, then `state.status` is set to `Complete`, and the comments are
      appended to the plan under the heading "Points to consider".
    * If the status is `Request changes`, `state.status` stays in `InProgress`. The critique is appended under the
      heading "Execution Plan review".
    * Increment `state.iterations` and repeat.
* Once `state.status` is `Complete`, re-initialise `state` for assess mode.

Notes:

* The full history of conversations, back-and-forths, and planning iterations must be stored in a convenient format
  for a supervisor to review. This lives in `.minesweeper/planning_history/`.
* A copy of the final plan is stored in `.minesweeper/final_plan.md`.

`.minesweeper/state.json` is of the following form:

```json5
{
  "mode": "Planning",   // Planning, Assess, Refine, or Execution
  "status": "InProgress",
  "iterations": 0,      // planning iterations completed
  "max_iterations": 5,  // copied from $MINESWEEPER_MAX_PLANNING_ITERATIONS
  "assessment": null,
}
```

### Assess mode

A sub-agent decides whether the plan should be executed all at once or broken up into smaller subtasks.

This mode does not change any code or the plan. It only saves the assessment in `state.assessment`. The result is
either `Execute` or `Refine`.

### Refine mode

In refine mode, no code is changed. Instead, the _plan_ is sent to an LLM subagent with the request to break it into
smaller, independent sub-tasks.

For each sub-task, a new GitHub issue is created with the full description of the sub-task, a link to the parent task,
and a recommended plan of action. The issue is labelled with `$MINESWEEPER_SUBTASK_LABEL`. If the parent task is
labelled `$MINESWEEPER_ALWAYS_FIX_LABEL`, the same label is added to the subtask.

After all subtasks are posted, `state.mode` is set to `Delegated`.

### Execution mode

When `state` enters execution mode, it looks like:

```json5
{
  "mode": "Execution",
  "status": "Writing",
  "iterations": 0,
  "max_iterations": 3, // copied from $MINESWEEPER_MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS
}
```

A sub-agent executes the plan in `.minesweeper/final_plan.md`. The agent picks up all context from `CLAUDE.md` and the
local `.claude/` settings, including default permissions.

* Once execution is complete, increment `state.iterations`.
* Commit changes with a detailed git message describing what was done.
* Then, until `state.status` is `Complete` or `state.iterations` >= `state.max_iterations`:
    * Set `state.status` to `Reviewing`.
    * Start a review sub-agent — preferably with a different model — to conduct a thorough review of every change in
      the branch (not just the last commit). The review compares the changes against the plan for completeness and
      checks the code for cleanliness, readability, correctness, and especially security.
    * The review concludes with one of `Approved`, `Approved with minor concerns`, `Changes requested`.
    * If the status is `Approved` or `Approved with minor concerns`, set `state.status` to `Complete`.
    * Save all review comments to `.minesweeper/review_comments.md`, overwriting any old comments.
    * If `state.status` is not `Complete`, start a new execution agent:
        * Set `state.status` to `Fixing review comments`.
        * The plan is background; the review comments are the focus.
        * Once execution is complete, increment `state.iterations`.
        * Commit changes with a detailed git message of what was done.
* Run final checks (formatting, tests). If tests fail at this point we **do not** loop back — CI will pick this up
  and the code owner decides what to do.
* Squash commits into a single commit message.
* Push a new PR to GitHub against `$MINESWEEPER_PR_BASE_BRANCH`, referencing this issue.

### Addressing PR review feedback

Once a Minesweeper PR is open, the daemon keeps watching it. On every poll tick, for every worktree whose state is
`mode = Execution, status = Complete` and has a recorded `prNumber`, the daemon checks the PR via `gh pr view`:

* If the PR has a fresh `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review, or a fresh unresolved review-thread comment, from an **authorised
  reviewer**, the daemon renders the new items to `.minesweeper/pr_review_comments.md`, flips the state to
  `mode = AddressingPRFeedback, status = InProgress`, and re-runs the executor against the original plan plus the
  rendered feedback.
* Authorised reviewers are the **repo owner** (`gh repo view --json owner`) plus every bare `@username` listed in the
  repo's `CODEOWNERS` file (one of `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `CODEOWNERS`, or `docs/CODEOWNERS`). `@org/team` entries are
  ignored in v0 — resolving teams to member logins is deferred.
* The executor's new commits are pushed with an **incremental `git push`** (no force, no re-squash) so the PR history
  stays readable and never overwrites a reviewer's own pushed commits. GitHub's squash-merge button still produces a
  single commit at merge time.
* A watermark (`prFeedbackProcessedAt` on `state.json`) records the newest review/comment timestamp the daemon has
  acted on, so the same feedback is never processed twice.
* If a reviewer force-pushes to the PR branch, the incremental push will fail and Minesweeper bails out — the issue is
  labelled with `$MINESWEEPER_FAILED_LABEL` and the worktree is preserved for a human to inspect.
* The feedback loop ends naturally when the issue is closed (e.g. PR merged); the closed-issue sweep then archives and
  removes the worktree as usual.

# Operating Minesweeper

## Prerequisites

1. Install `gh` and authenticate it against the target repo (`gh auth login`, or set `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`).
2. Install Node.js 20+ and run `npm install` in this checkout.
3. Authenticate the Claude Agent SDK. The simplest path is to log in once with the Claude Code CLI; alternatively
   set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment.
4. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and adjust any values you want to override. Every variable is optional.

## Labelling issues for autofix

The simplest workflow is to apply the always-fix label to issues you want Minesweeper to pick up:

```sh
# One-off:
gh issue edit <N> --add-label autofix

# Or seed the labels on a fresh repo first:
node dist/cli.js labels --force
```

The `labels` subcommand creates / updates every label Minesweeper relies on (`autofix`, `tryFix`, `manual`,
`possiblyDangerous`, `manuallyReviewed`, `minesweeperFailed`, `subtask`) with sensible colours and descriptions.

For issues filed by people whose intent you trust less than your own — community contributors, or your past self in a
hurry — apply `tryFix` instead of `autofix`. The issue still gets picked up automatically, but only after the
prompt-injection screener (`prompts/screener.md`) clears it. The screener is a Haiku call costing ~$0.001 per issue.

When filing issues you want Minesweeper to handle, use the **Autofix** issue template
(`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/autofix.md`) — it pre-applies the label and provides a body shaped for the planner prompt.

## Running the daemon

```sh
node dist/cli.js run
```

The daemon prints a pretty stream of events: `polled (N eligible) → dispatching → planning → executing → reviewing
→ PR opened`. Stop it with `Ctrl+C`; it drains in-flight children before exiting.

## Cron schedules and the JSON config file

The daemon's poll cadence is configurable in two ways. By default it polls every
`MINESWEEPER_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` seconds (the legacy fixed interval). For
operators who want polling concentrated into known windows — say, every fifteen
minutes during business hours plus one nightly sweep — the config file at
`~/.minesweeper/config.json` accepts a list of cron expressions:

```json
{
  "schedule": ["*/15 * * * *", "0 2 * * *"],
  "pollCooldownSeconds": 120
}
```

Notes:

- Configuration precedence is `env > file > defaults`. Anything in the JSON file
  is overridable from the environment. The path is overridable via
  `MINESWEEPER_CONFIG_FILE`.
- `schedule` is **file-only** — cron list fields contain commas, which can't
  round-trip through a comma-delimited env var.
- Schedules are interpreted in the daemon process's local timezone.
- A single global `pollCooldownSeconds` (default 120) gates every tick. Two
  schedules that align cannot both fire inside the cooldown window — the second
  is logged as `skipped poll: within cooldown (Ns since last)` and dropped.
  Set `pollCooldownSeconds: 0` to disable the gate.
- **Cron-only configurations do not fire an immediate poll at startup.** The
  first poll happens at the first cron match. Interval mode (no `schedule`
  configured) keeps the legacy "fire one tick immediately on startup" behaviour
  so operators see `polled (N eligible)` without waiting out the interval.

## Inspecting transcripts

`minesweeper log view <name>` pretty-prints a JSONL transcript captured by the planner / critic / executor / reviewer
under `<worktree>/.minesweeper/planning_history/`. Pass a bare name (`planner-01`) and the command resolves it
relative to the current worktree; pass an explicit path (or one ending in `.jsonl`) to view archived runs.

```sh
# Inside an active worktree, page through the first planning round:
minesweeper log view planner-01 | less -R
# Strip colour for grep / sed pipelines:
minesweeper log view planner-01 --no-color | grep tool_result
# Show full bodies (default caps each message body at 40 lines):
minesweeper log view executor-01 --max-lines 0
```

## Logs and post-mortem

* **Structured logs** — JSON, one line per event, in `.minesweeper/logs/daemon.log` (rotated by Minesweeper). Useful
  with `jq`. Per-issue children write their own logs into `<worktree>/.minesweeper/logs/`.
* **Pretty stdout** — `chalk`-coloured summaries; this is the human-readable view.
* **Successful runs** — when a child exits 0 the daemon leaves the worktree on disk and only logs `child exited 0;
  worktree at … kept until issue is closed`. The PR reviewer can poke at `<worktree>/.minesweeper/` while the PR is
  open. Once the issue is closed (typically by the PR being merged), the next poll tick's sweep archives
  `.minesweeper/` under `$MINESWEEPER_WORKTREE_PATH/archive/<issue>-<timestamp>/` and removes the worktree.
* **Failed runs** — the worktree is **left in place** at `$MINESWEEPER_WORKTREE_PATH/<branch>` and the issue is
  tagged with `$MINESWEEPER_FAILED_LABEL`. Inspect the run with:

  ```sh
  cat $MINESWEEPER_WORKTREE_PATH/<branch>/.minesweeper/state.json
  ls $MINESWEEPER_WORKTREE_PATH/<branch>/.minesweeper/
  ```

  When you're done, close the issue (e.g. as "not planned") — the next sweep tick will archive and remove the
  worktree for you. If you want to clean up sooner, `git worktree remove` works too.

# Bootstrap mode — using Minesweeper to develop Minesweeper

Minesweeper is built to dogfood itself. From plan 10 onwards we file `autofix`-labelled issues against this very repo
and let the daemon raise the PRs. While that's exciting, it's also where things can go sideways fastest, so the
following safety rules apply during the bootstrap milestones (M1 → end of M2):

* **Run only against issues you filed yourself.** Do not point bootstrap-mode Minesweeper at issues filed by external
  contributors until the prompt-injection screen lands in plan 11.
* **Keep `MINESWEEPER_DEFAULT_ELIGIBLE=false`.** The always-fix label is the only opt-in path during bootstrap.
* **The main checkout is never touched.** The daemon only ever operates inside generated worktrees, so uncommitted
  work in your main checkout is safe by construction.
* **Review every PR.** Bootstrap-mode Minesweeper opens PRs the same way a human contributor would — they go through
  the normal CI + review path. Do not auto-merge.
* **Stop on red.** If two consecutive runs produce broken PRs, stop the daemon and inspect the worktrees rather than
  letting it churn.

After the M1 self-hosting test (see `plans/10_eligibility_label_only_and_readme.md`) and M2 lands, these rules
relax — at that point the prompt-injection screen makes external issues safer to accept, and assess/refine modes
let Minesweeper decompose its own work.
